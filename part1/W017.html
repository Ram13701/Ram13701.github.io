        The modern Olympic Games or Olympics (French: Jeux olympiques)[a][1] are
        the leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter
        sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world
        participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are
        considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200
        teams, representing sovereign states and territories, participating. By
        default, the Games generally substitute for any world championships
        during the year in which they take place (however, each class usually
        maintains its own records).[2] The Olympic Games are held every four
        years. Since 1994, they have alternated between the Summer and Winter
        Olympics every two years during the four-year Olympiad.[3][4]

        Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, held in
        Olympia, Greece from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron
        Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in
        1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896. The IOC is
        the governing body of the Olympic Movement, which encompasses all
        entities and individuals involved in the Olympic Games. The Olympic
        Charter defines their structure and authority.
