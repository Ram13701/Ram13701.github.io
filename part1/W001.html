  The modern Olympic Games or Olympics (French: Jeux olympiques)[a][1] are the
  leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports
  competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate
  in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's
  foremost sports competition with more than 200 teams, representing sovereign
  states and territories, participating. By default, the Games generally
  substitute for any world championships during the year in which they take
  place (however, each class usually maintains its own records).[2] The Olympic
  Games are held every four years. Since 1994, they have alternated between the
  Summer and Winter Olympics every two years during the four-year Olympiad
